Different algorithms affect the ratio
Alsom we can change our hit/miss ratio by changing the way we request data. If there are a lot of similar requests, the hit ratio should be higher.
For example:
1 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 1 2 3 3 3 
Probably has higher hit rate than the following sequence:
0 10 20 1 3 8 9 12 41 2 5 6 73 234 32 1 235  543 3 2
